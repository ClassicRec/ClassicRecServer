everything with be ran off Replit.
# What is ClassicRec?

Classic Rec is:

A server live 24/7? ✅

A server that is fast and reliable? ✅

A server with a dev that wants to make it the
very best? ✅

Classic Rec is NOT:

A localhost server? ❌

A server that is janky and low effort? ❌

# Replit
Replit is a website similar to GitHub in
which I will be running my server off. Replit
is a great way to get into old Rec Room
development as it is FREE to use! However if
you want your servers to be faster, you can
pay an optional subscription which only
costs $7 a month!
